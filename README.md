Hey there! 👋

I'm Billal, a full-stack developer passionate about building clean, scalable, and purposeful digital experiences.

I love turning ideas into functional products — if something sparks my curiosity, chances are I’ll prototype it, refine it, and turn it into something real.

My main tech stack is MERN, along with strong experience in Java, SQL, OOP, algorithms, and modern web tooling.
I enjoy working with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and I’m always exploring new technologies that make development smarter and faster.

I’ve built multiple projects — some public, many private — and I'm constantly working on something new to sharpen my craft.

If you want to see what I’m working on, feel free to explore my repos anytime!
